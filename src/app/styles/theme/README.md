# Theming
Simple `LESS` themes can be written for the Angular Buyer application and should be kept in the `theme/` directory. `Orderly` is our in-house theme and can be referenced as an example when building custom themes.
```
theme/
  |- orderly/
  |  |- _bootswatch.less
  |  |- _orderly.less
  |  |- _variables.less
```
